# SCHEDULE GENERATOR

## Start with 8 teams

- use real teams to calculate distance traveled?
- give each team a 'rank' based on 'last season'
- games are either 'home' or 'away'
    give 'home' or 'away' their own 'difficulty' value (constant).
- schedules should include 'buys'
- season is a fixed number of weeks long.

## HTML

- the parameters for the object constructor should probably be taken from an HTML form
